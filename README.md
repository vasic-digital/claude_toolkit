# 🧰 Claude Toolkit

### Run many Claude Code accounts on one host — with one unified brain.

One alias per account. Shared history, memory, plugins, settings, and sessions
across all of them. Plus turn any LLM API key into a Claude Code alias, share
your whole plugin ecosystem with OpenCode, and auto-name a per-project session
on every launch.

## Why

Running more than one Claude Code account on a machine normally means siloed
worlds: each account has its own conversation history, project memory, todos,
plans, and installed plugins, and nothing carries over. Claude Toolkit collapses
that into **one shared store** — every account is mostly symlinks into it — so
switching accounts is just a shell alias, and your work, memory, and plugins
follow you. Only the things that *must* stay private (credentials, auth state)
remain per-account.

```bash
claude1     # account 1 — your shared projects, memory, plugins, sessions
claude2     # account 2 — the SAME shared projects, memory, plugins, sessions
deepseek    # the same ecosystem, running on DeepSeek's best model
```

## ✨ Features

- **🔗 Unified multi-account store.** One alias per account (`claude1`, `claude2`,
  … or custom names). A single `~/.claude-shared/` holds `projects/`, `todos/`,
  `tasks/`, `plans/`, `history.jsonl`, `settings.json`, `plugins/`, `CLAUDE.md`
  and more; each account dir is symlinks into it.
- **♻️ Cross-account session resume.** The `projects`/session index in
  `.claude.json` is deep-merged across accounts on every launch — a session
  started under `claude1` shows up in `claude2`'s `--resume` list, and vice
  versa. Auth keys never cross.
- **🏷️ Per-project auto-session naming.** Every bare alias launch resumes — or
  first-time creates — **one long-lived session per project root**, named after
  the directory in `kebab-case` (`Android 15` → `android-15`). Open `claude2` in
  a project and you're back in the same ongoing work, properly named — even if
  the session was previously unnamed. *(Color: a deterministic per-alias `/color`
  hint is printed; Claude Code's `/color` is TUI-only and can't be auto-applied —
  see [SESSION_COLOR.md](docs/SESSION_COLOR.md).)*
- **🌐 Any LLM as a Claude Code alias.** `claude-providers` turns every API key in
  your keys file into its own alias pointed at that provider's strongest model —
  fully dynamic (no hardcoded providers/URLs/models), secrets never leave the
  keys file. [Provider guide →](docs/Provider_Aliases_User_Guide.md)
- **🔌 Share your ecosystem with OpenCode.** `claude-opencode-sync` exposes every
  Claude plugin's Skills + MCP servers + `CLAUDE.md` to a host-installed
  [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) in one command. [OpenCode guide →](OpenCode_Integration.md)
- **🪙 TOON encoding utility.** `toon.mjs` / `toon_encode.py` encode JSON to
  [TOON](docs/TOON_Integration.md) (~40% fewer tokens for structured prompt
  data). [TOON guide →](docs/TOON_Integration.md)
- **🛟 Safe & reversible.** Every destructive step is backed up; `claude-rollback`
  restores everything. Idempotent installers. Verified on Linux and macOS.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vasic-digital/claude-toolkit/main/scripts/curl-install.sh | bash
```

Clones to `~/claude-toolkit` (or pulls if present), installs missing
dependencies via your system package manager, runs the full setup, and wires the
aliases into your shell. Re-run anytime to update.

Then open a new shell and:

```bash
claude-list-accounts     # see what's wired up
claude1                  # launch account 1 (auto-resumes this project's session)
```

<details>
<summary><b>Manual install</b></summary>

**A. Host already has ≥1 `~/.claude-*` account:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vasic-digital/claude-toolkit.git claude-toolkit
cd claude-toolkit
bash scripts/install.sh         # symlink scripts onto PATH, write managed alias
                                # file, source from rc files, unify existing
                                # accounts, install the TOON dep, refresh docs.
exec $SHELL -l
claude-list-accounts
```

**B. Clean-slate host (Claude Code installed, no accounts yet):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vasic-digital/claude-toolkit.git claude-toolkit
cd claude-toolkit
bash scripts/claude-bootstrap.sh --count 2 --yes     # provision claude1, claude2
exec $SHELL -l
claude1 /login && claude2 /login                      # authenticate each once
```

`--aliases personal,work` for custom names; `--dir-of NAME=PATH` to override a
config dir. Both installers are **idempotent**.

## 🧩 Requirements

`bash`, `rsync`, `jq`, `awk`. Optional: `node`+`npm` (TOON utility), `pandoc`
(+ `weasyprint`/`wkhtmltopdf`/headless `chromium`) for doc regeneration.

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install bash jq rsync gawk pandoc weasyprint
```

macOS ships bash 3.2; the scripts auto-re-exec under Homebrew bash when needed,
and only touch `~/.zshrc` on Darwin.

## 🗂️ Layout after unification

```
~/.claude-shared/                   # single source of truth
  projects/ todos/ tasks/ plans/ plugins/ sessions/ …
  CLAUDE.md  history.jsonl  settings.json  stats-cache.json

~/.claude-<account>/                # per-account — mostly symlinks
  .credentials.json                 # PRIVATE — account-locked
  .claude.json                      # per-account state (non-auth contents sync)
  mcp-needs-auth-cache.json         # PRIVATE
  projects -> ~/.claude-shared/projects   # every shared item is a symlink

~/.local/share/claude-multi-account/aliases.sh   # managed alias file
```

## 🔄 How cross-account sync works

Claude Code keeps a `projects.<path>` map inside each account's `.claude.json`
(`lastSessionId`, MCP status, project memory pointers). Without intervention,
account A's projects are invisible to account B even though the JSONL transcripts
live in the shared `projects/`. The toolkit fixes this in two layers:

1. **At unify time** — `claude-unify` deep-merges every account's `.claude.json`
   (rightmost-wins on scalars, recursive union of the `projects` subtree),
   writing each account's auth-private keys back untouched.
2. **At runtime** — the `cma_run` wrapper calls `claude-sync-state pull` before
   each launch and `push` after exit (a fast `jq` merge), so sessions created in
   one account appear in the others on the next launch.

Auth keys (`userID`, `oauthAccount`, `firstStartTime`, `claudeCodeFirstTokenDate`)
never cross accounts.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
bash scripts/tests/run-all.sh                 # all hermetic suites (sandboxed $HOME)
bash scripts/tests/run-all.sh lib unify session   # subset by suffix
bash scripts/tests/run-proof.sh               # hermetic + live verifiers + evidence bundle
```

Tests use a sandboxed `$HOME` via `mktemp` — your real `~/.claude*` is never
touched. The suite is **58 files, all green**, and `shellcheck -S error` is
clean (62 warning-level and 203 style-level suggestions remain); live verifiers
(`verify_*_live.sh`) prove behavior against the real OpenCode/provider state and
write inspectable evidence to `scripts/tests/proof/`.

## 🚦 Releasing — the LIVE gate is mandatory

```bash
claude-release-gate                       # sandbox suite + LIVE alias smoke
claude-release-gate --verify-providers    # + full LLMsVerifier model scan
claude-release-gate --provider poe        # smoke through a different provider
```

**No release commit without a green `claude-release-gate`.** The sandbox suite
proves wrapper *logic* but is structurally blind to real-host state — v1.25.1
shipped fully green while every router alias on the real host was bricked by a
PATH-shadowing `ccr` doppelgänger, and the live smoke then caught two more
real defects (a mis-sliced HelixLLM context and ~330k tokens of auto-resumed
session history) within minutes of existing. The gate drives the REAL
generated alias through the REAL PATH → ccr → route-apply → proxy → backend
and asserts the served reply plus the sink-side route. Fail-closed: any layer
red = do not release.

## ↩️ Rollback

```bash
claude-rollback        # == claude-unify --rollback
```

Restores every `.preunify.<timestamp>` backup and moves the shared store aside to
`~/.claude-shared.removed.<timestamp>`.
